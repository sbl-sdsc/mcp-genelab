[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/mcp_genelab.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/mcp-genelab)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that converts natural language queries into [Cypher](https://neo4j.com/product/cypher-graph-query-language) queries and executes them against the configured Neo4j endpoints. Customized tools provide seamless access to the NASA [GeneLab Knowledge Graph](https://github.com/BaranziniLab/spoke_genelab), enabling AI-assisted analysis of spaceflight experiments and their biological effects. This server allows researchers to query differential gene expression and DNA methylation data from NASA's space biology experiments through natural language interactions with AI assistants like Claude.

The GeneLab Knowledge Graph with data from NASA's [GeneLab Data Repository](https://genelab.nasa.gov/), part of the NASA [Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)](https://science.nasa.gov/biological-physical/data/osdr/), can be integrated with biomedical knowledge from the [SPOKE](https://spoke.ucsf.edu/) (Scalable Precision Medicine Open Knowledge Engine) knowledge graph. This integration connects spaceflight experimental results with a comprehensive biological context, including genes, proteins, anatomical structures, pathways, and diseases.

This server is part of the NSF-funded [Proto-OKN Project](https://www.proto-okn.net/) (Prototype Open Knowledge Network). It's an extension of the [Neo4j Cypher MCP server](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/mcp-neo4j/tree/main/servers/mcp-neo4j-cypher).

## Features

## Installation

### Prerequisites

The MCP GeneLab server requires the `uv` package manager to be installed on your system. If you don't have it installed run:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```
# Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

> **Note**: Once `uv` is installed, the `uvx` command in the configuration below will automatically download and run the latest version of the MCP server from PyPI when needed.

### Claude Desktop Setup

**Recommended for most users**

1. **Download and Install Claude Desktop**

   Visit [https://claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download) and install Claude Desktop for your operating system.

   > **Requirements**: Claude Pro or Max subscription is required for MCP server functionality.

2. **Configure MCP Server**

   **Option A: Download Pre-configured File (Recommended)**

   Download the pre-configured `claude_desktop_config.json` file with Neo4j endpoints from the repository and copy it to the appropriate location:

   **macOS**:
   ```bash
   # Download the config file
   curl -o /tmp/claude_desktop_config.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sbl-sdsc/mcp-genelab/main/config/claude_desktop_config.json
   
   # Copy to Claude Desktop configuration directory
   cp /tmp/claude_desktop_config.json "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Claude/"
   ```

   **Windows PowerShell**:
   ```powershell
   # Download the config file
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sbl-sdsc/mcp-genelab/main/config/claude_desktop_config.json" -OutFile "$env:TEMP\claude_desktop_config.json"
   
   # Copy to Claude Desktop configuration directory
   Copy-Item "$env:TEMP\claude_desktop_config.json" "$env:APPDATA\Claude\"
   ```

   **Option B: Manual Configuration**

   Alternatively, you can manually edit the configuration file in Claude Desktop. Navigate to `Claude->Settings->Developer->Edit Config`
   to edit it.

   Below is an example of how to configure local and remote Neo4j endpoints. For remotely hosted Neo4j servers, update the url, username, and password.

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
      "genelab-local-cypher": {
         "command": "uvx",
         "args": ["mcp-genelab"],
         "env": {
           "NEO4J_URI": "bolt://localhost:7687",
           "NEO4J_USERNAME": "neo4j",
           "NEO4J_PASSWORD": "neo4jdemo",
           "NEO4J_DATABASE": "spoke-genelab-v0.0.4",
           "INSTRUCTIONS": "Query the GeneLab Knowledge Graph to identify NASA spaceflight experiments containing omics datasets, specifically differential gene expression (transcriptomics) and DNA methylation (epigenomics) data."
         }
       },
       "genelab-remote-cypher": {
         "command": "uvx",
         "args": ["mcp-genelab"],
         "env": {
           "NEO4J_URI": "bolt://remote_url:7687",
           "NEO4J_USERNAME": "username",
           "NEO4J_PASSWORD": "password",
           "NEO4J_DATABASE": "spoke-genelab-v0.0.4",
           "INSTRUCTIONS": "Query the GeneLab Knowledge Graph to identify NASA spaceflight experiments containing omics datasets, specifically differential gene expression (transcriptomics) and DNA methylation (epigenomics) data."
         }
      }
   }
   ```

   > **Important**: If you have existing MCP server configurations, do not use Option A as it will overwrite your existing configuration. Instead, use Option B and manually merge the Neo4j endpoints with your existing `mcpServers` configuration.

3. **Restart Claude Desktop**

   After saving the configuration file, quit Claude Desktop completely and restart it. The application needs to restart to load the new configuration and start the MCP servers.

4. **Verify Installation**

   1. Launch Claude Desktop
   2. Navigate to `Claude->Settings->Connectors`
   3. Verify that the configured Neo4j endpoints appear in the connector list
   4. You can configure each service to always ask for permission or to run it unsupervised (recommended)

### VS Code Setup

**For advanced users and developers**

1. **Install VS Code Insiders**

   Download and install VS Code Insiders from [https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/)

   > **Note**: VS Code Insiders is required as it includes the latest MCP (Model Context Protocol) features.

2. **Install GitHub Copilot Extension**

   - Open VS Code Insiders
   - Sign in with your GitHub account
   - Install the GitHub Copilot extension

   > **Requirements**: GitHub Copilot subscription is required for MCP integration.

3. **Configure Workspace**

   Create or edit `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace:

   ```json

     "servers": {
       "genelab-local-cypher": {
         "command": "uvx",
         "args": ["mcp-genelab"],
         "env": {
           "NEO4J_URI": "bolt://localhost:7687",
           "NEO4J_USERNAME": "neo4j",
           "NEO4J_PASSWORD": "neo4jdemo",
           "NEO4J_DATABASE": "spoke-genelab-v0.0.4",
           "INSTRUCTIONS": "Query the GeneLab Knowledge Graph to identify NASA spaceflight experiments containing omics datasets, specifically differential gene expression (transcriptomics) and DNA methylation (epigenomics) data."
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   4. The MCP servers will automatically connect and provide knowledge graph access


## Quick Start

Once configured, you can immediately start querying knowledge graphs through natural language prompts in Claude Desktop or VS Code chat interface. The AI assistant will automatically convert your natural language queries into appropriate Cypher queries, execute them against the configured endpoints, and return structured, interpretable results.

### Example Queries

1. **Querying Specific MCP Servers**

To direct a query to a specific MCP server, use the @ operator followed by the server name.
For example:

```
@genelab-remote-cypher
```
See [response](docs/examples.md#Query-1).

2. **Federated Queries Across Multiple Servers**

You can also perform federated queries across multiple MCP servers.

```
@genelab-remote-cypher @spokeokn-remote-cypher
```

This will execute the query across both servers and combine the results as applicable.

See [response](docs/examples.md#Query-2).

3. **Node Metadata**
```
Describe the Assay node and its properties in @genelab-remote-cypher, and include an example for a ground control vs. space flight comparison.
```
See [response](docs/examples.md#Query-3).

4. **Relationship Metadata**
```
Describe the MEASURED_DIFFERENTIAL_EXPRESSION_ASmMG relationship and its properties in @genelab-remote-cypher, and include an example for a ground control vs. space flight comparison.
```
See [response](docs/examples.md#Query-4).

5. **High-level overview of the GeneLab KG**
```
Give a breakdown of missions, studies, and the type of technologies used in the studies.
 ```
See [response](docs/examples.md#Query-5).

6. **Find upregulated genes in space flight:**
```
Find the top 5 upregulated genes in mouse liver tissue during Space Flight.
```
See [response](docs/examples.md#Query-6).
